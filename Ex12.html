<!-- 12.	Create a simple search form using a search input element in which the user can enter 
a search query. Using the Firefox web browser, test the form by entering January and submitting the 
form. Then enter a J in the input element to see previous entries that started with J—January should be 
displayed below the input element. Enter June and submit the form again. Now enter a J in the input 
element to see previous entries that started with J—January 
and June should be displayed below the input element. Try this with your own search queries as well. -->
